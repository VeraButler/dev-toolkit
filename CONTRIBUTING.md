# How to contribute
Thanks for wanting to help improve the toolkit! üòÉ
<br>Below are some instructions to get you started.

### Installation
First, let's install and link the `dev-toolkit`. The repo contains multiple packages & [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is the tool of choice to handle these. Have a look at the root `package.json`-file for a list of all used `npm run` commands. For the basics, you'll want to:
- git clone [**`dev-toolkit`**](https://github.com/stoikerty/dev-toolkit) repo into a folder (example: `repos/local_modules/dev-toolkit`)
- run `npm run install` to install all the dependencies for all packages and cross-link them. You might have to run this command with elevated privileges (`sudo`) if you encounter any issues. The installation will take a bit of time ‚òïÔ∏è <br>Don't worry it's not stuck, `lerna` just doesn't display the installation output.
- You now have the `dev-toolkit`-command available to you (if not, use `sudo` in the previous step). Try using the command `dev-toolkit -v`.<br>You might also want to link a package to your project specifically by running `npm link dev-toolkit` or `npm link dynamic-pages` inside your project folder.

Preparation done.

### Development
This is very much an iteration phase, you'll encounter mystical errors that you'll have to fix, caching problems and whatnot. Feel free to ask a question in [the dev-toolkit chat](https://gitter.im/stoikerty/dev-toolkit) if you're stuck. Good luck! üòé
- inside the `dev-toolkit` folder, run `npm run watch` to convert all ES2015+ files into ES5
- Now you're ready to use the toolkit via the command `dev-toolkit`.
- Follow the instructions in the [Readme](/Readme.md) to create a new project
- make changes to toolkit & document what you did
