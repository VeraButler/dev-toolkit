TODO:
- add script for build
- add script for watch
- add script for publish?
- move readme for toolkit to root, check urls
- change homepage urls in package.json
- publish both packages

Necessities:
- install all dependencies for all packages at once
- build & watch all packages at once
- build each package individually on `npm publish` of a package
