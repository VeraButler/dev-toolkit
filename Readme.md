Goals & Purpose:
- fast to setup
- run multiple apps using the same underlying principles
- as little configuration as necessary
- powerful enough to run production-scale apps
- defer testing and additional setup to app

TODO:
- add script for build
- add script for watch
- add script for publish?
- move readme for toolkit to root, check urls
- change homepage urls in package.json
- publish both packages

Additional TODO for better docs with animated clips:
- gif for starting a project
- gif for when one creates a syntax/eslint error
- gif for testing with watch command
- gif for generating dynamic pages

Necessities:
- install all dependencies for all packages at once
- build & watch all packages at once
- build each package individually on `npm publish` of a package
